Implement Caesar cipher: - Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
Encryption and Decryption are fundamental processes in cryptography used to secure information and protect it from unauthorized access.
Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a mathematical algorithm and a key. This transformation ensures that only authorized individuals with the correct key can access the original data.
Purpose: To ensure the confidentiality of information.
Decryption is the reverse process, where the ciphertext is transformed back into its original readable form (plaintext) using the appropriate key.
Purpose: To allow authorized users to retrieve and understand the original information.
One of the simplest and earliest methods of encryption is the Caesar Cipher, which demonstrates the basic principles of cryptography: substitution and key-based transformation.
Working of the Caesar Cipher:
Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet, determined by a numerical key. If the shift moves past the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the beginning.
Example â€“ Caesar Cipher (Encryption/Decryption):
Type 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: d  
Enter your message: hello chai  
Enter the shift value (integer): 123  
Decrypted Message: olssv johp
In this example, each character is shifted based on the given key (123). The Caesar Cipher illustrates how even simple techniques can secure data through transformation, making it unreadable without the correct key.
